<h1>Using <i>tearsheet!</i></h1>
<article>
    <p class="help_text">
    <dfn>tearsheet!</dfn> is a tool for quickly grabbing datapoints from the American Community Survey 
    or other datasets that Data Driven Detroit has compiled, aggregated to your chosen geographies. It
    is optimized to make this basic task as straight forward as possible, but the tool provides you with a few
    tricks.
    </p>
    
    <h2>üåê Specifying a geography</h2>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p class="help_text">
    Geographies can be any Census-style geography. Counties, county subdivisions, tracts, zip codes, are 
    all available. Each of these will be identified by their geoid on a taresheet. If you don't know the
    geoid off the top of your head, that's okay! If you type in the name of the geography you're looking for
    you a menu of options will appear where you can choose.
    </p>

    <h3>Advanced</h3>
    <p class="help_text">
    Often, it's useful to select all of a smaller geography level falling within a larger 
    geography. This can be done with a specification trick: use the '|' character.

    
    For example, say you want to get all the zip codes in Detroit, MI. You can do that by starting
    your search with 'zips|' then searching for Detroit like normal. Once you've identified the Detroit
    geoid, your final search term will look like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre><code class="help_text">
    zips|06000US2616322000
    </code></pre>
    <p class="help_text">
    Then once you click the 'add', all Detroit zip codes will be added to your taresheet.
    </p>
    <h2>üìä Specifying an indicator</h2>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p class="help_text">
    Following the ACS, basic indicators are specified by their ACS variable name. Again, we don't expect
    people to memorize these. Instead, try search terms to find the ACS table and variable that you'd like
    and click 'add.'
    </p>
    <h3>Advanced</h3>
    <h4>Aliasing</h4>
    <p class="help_text">
    We don't expect people to remember ACS variable names, and you shouldn't expect your colleagues to remember
    them either. Aliasing is a way to help. To alias a variable, you can follow the same approach as you did with
    the geography. Add the alias then a '|' then you can search for the variable that you're looking for. The final
    spec will look like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="help_text">
    total_pop|B01001001
    </code></pre>

    <p class="help_text">
    Now on your final tearsheet, the indicator name will read total_pop and not the unreadable ACS table name (but now
    you need a data dictionary? We have you covered!)
    </p>

    <h4>Crisp</h4>
    <p class="help_text">
    <dfn>Crisp</dfn> is a tiny version of Lisp that you can use to make custom indicators using ACS variables. We based
    this on LISP (abbreviation of "list processing") because we found that often making custom ACS indicators, the formulas
    end up being sums of lists of variables somtimes divided by sums of other lists. Lots of lists, so a lisp-like language
    seemed appropriate. This version is stripped down to basics, only able to use ACS variable names as variables, along with 
    numbers. The only operators that are available for Crisp are +, -, *, /, \<, \>, \<=, \>=. No other Lisp keywords are 
    available.
    </p>
    <p class="help_text">
    The syntax for writing custom variables is very simple. First, provide an alias. All Crisp-based indicators require one. Then, start your
    custom indicator with an opening parenthesis '(', then one of the operators listed above. Then put any number of ACS variables separated by
    spaces, then a closing parenthesis, ')'. The operator that you placed at the first will then be applied cumulatively to all variables.
